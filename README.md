# KartingSDK

Hi there! We at Replay decided to make our own custom server host for LBP Karting.
It's called KartingSDK.
KartingSDK is NOT a development kit. SDK stands for something else.

Since KSDK is in it's extreemly early stages, we reccomend not using it for now.
You CAN still use it, just note that any data loss does not make us liable; Once you begin using KSDK, you have full responsibility on what happens.

Feel free to contribute to the project! Thanks in advance!
